# Trip-Calculator
Helps people evenly divide costs of a trip.

This project was made using Visual Studio 2019. The project template was an ASP.NET Web Application (.NET Framework) with MVC. The Framwork used was .NET Framework 4.7.1

Once you clone the solution, open the solution in visual studio and perform a NuGet package restore. Then run the TripCalculator project. This should launch the application in the browser and create a local database.
Along with the web application, there is also a unit test project in the same solution. I only created two unit tests, but I set up the infrastructure (such as mock objects) in order for furthur tests to be written easily.
